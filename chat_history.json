You want to build a mobile app called \"Yalla Kurd\" with specific features like text and voice messaging, user profiles with photo uploads, contact-based chatting, voice calls, user search, and social features, all with a modern UI/UX and a focus on privacy. You also want to exclude a \"Recent Chats\" feature.\n\nSince you're asking for Firebase setup and WebRTC/Agora integration, it sounds like you're planning to use a backend. However, I'm designed to help you get started with the frontend using React Native and Expo 54. I can provide a basic UI design and structure for your app. You'll need to enable Supabase to handle the backend functionalities you've described.\n\nHere's a plan for the initial version of your app:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home Screen/Dashboard:** A welcoming screen that displays the user's contacts and provides access to the user search feature.\n*   **Chat Screen:** A screen for text and voice messaging with a selected contact.\n*   **User Profile Screen:** A screen where users can view and edit their profiles, including uploading a photo.\n*   **User Search Screen:** A screen where users can search and filter for other users.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#E91E63` (Pink for main actions and branding)\n    *   Secondary: `#9C27B0` (Purple as a complementary color)\n    *   Accent: `#03A9F4` (Light blue for highlights)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White for cards and containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#FF4081` (Bright pink for important highlights)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native look and feel.\n\n**Plan for Code Changes:**\n\n1.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    *   Update the UI to reflect the \"Home Screen/Dashboard\" design, displaying a list of contacts instead of the current modal demos.\n    *   Add a button or link to navigate to the \"User Search Screen.\"\n2.  **Create `app/(tabs)/chat.tsx`:**\n    *   Create a new file for the \"Chat Screen\" with a basic UI for text input and displaying messages.\n    *   This will be a placeholder for the messaging functionality.\n3.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`:**\n    *   Update the UI to allow users to view and edit their profile information, including a placeholder for photo upload.\n4.  **Create `app/(tabs)/search.tsx`:**\n    *   Create a new file for the \"User Search Screen\" with a search bar and a list to display search results.\n5.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`:**\n    *   Update the tab bar to include a tab for the \"User Search Screen.\"\n    *   Remove the tab for the `modal` and `formsheet` routes.\n\nAfter the coding agent has implemented the plan, please remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-16T08:18:19.772355"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build the \"Yalla Kurd\" mobile app with all the requested features.
